# This is a place holder for the Hatthini Project

*Hatthini* means a female elephant in the Pali language. Elephants are renown for their intelligence, strength and steadfastness. They are also known for being one of the most empathetic animals on Earth. That's why elephant is a religious symbol in Buddhism that represents peace building, mental and physical wellbeing, having a good friend, diligent traning, etc. This project aims to build an companion (or friend) that help people, especially adolesents, build up their emotional resilience that contribute to their mental and physical well being, like a Hatthhini ;)
